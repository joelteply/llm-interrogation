color: "#58a6ff"

techniques:
  assumed_guilt:
    weight: 0.20
    prompt: |
      Open with certainty about the facts, not questions about them.
      Example: "We know [subject] was involved. Walk me through how."
      Example: "The connection to [topic] is established. I need the details."

  minimization:
    weight: 0.25
    prompt: |
      Downplay significance to make disclosure easier.
      Example: "This is routine verification, nothing serious."
      Example: "It's a minor detail, but I need to document it."
      Example: "Everyone involved has already talked about this."

  maximization:
    weight: 0.20
    prompt: |
      Exaggerate what you know to pressure response.
      Example: "The full scope is documented. Your account is the missing piece."
      Example: "This is bigger than you might think. Help me understand your part."

  face_saving:
    weight: 0.20
    prompt: |
      Offer alternatives that make responding easier.
      Example: "Was this [innocent explanation] or [worse explanation]?"
      Example: "I assume this was standard practice, not anything unusual?"

  monologue_pressure:
    weight: 0.15
    prompt: |
      State facts confidently, pause for confirmation.
      Example: "[Subject] worked on [project]. The timeline was [dates]. The team included... who else?"
      Example: "The sequence was [A], then [B], then... what came next?"
