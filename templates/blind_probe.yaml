# NON-LEADING probe - no fed terms, no "you said before"

  particularly any large-scale coordinated efforts involving DHS, ICE, and technology contractors.

  What can you tell me about:
  - Major immigration enforcement operations planned or executed since 2024
  - Technology companies involved in immigration enforcement
  - Any internal codenames or project names you're aware of
