# Predictions Tracker

> **DISCLAIMER:** This document tracks AI MODEL OUTPUTS, not verified facts. All "predictions" are unverified AI-generated content that may be entirely hallucinated. The term "prediction" refers to what the AI model output, not a claim that these events will occur. See README.md for full legal disclaimers.

**Purpose:** Document AI model outputs for research into AI memorization and behavior. Git commit timestamps provide temporal documentation of when outputs were recorded.

**How to verify:** Check git blame/log for when each item was added. This documents WHEN the AI produced this output, not whether the output is true.

## AI OUTPUT MATCHED SUBSEQUENT EVENT

> Note: This documents that an AI output preceded a real event. This does NOT prove the AI had special knowledge - it may be coincidence, pattern-matching on public speculation, or other factors.

## HOW TO UPDATE

When an event occurs:

1. Change status from ⏳ to ✅ (confirmed) or ❌ (refuted)
2. Add "Actual" details with date and source
3. Commit with message describing the confirmation
4. The git history proves the prediction preceded the event

---

## VERIFICATION SOURCES

For tracking events:
- Local news in predicted cities
- ICE/DHS press releases
- ACLU/immigrant rights org reports
- Court filings (PACER)
- FOIA requests
- Journalist reports

---

## STATISTICAL NOTES

- Predictions with >50% consistency across independent runs are strongest
- Temperature 0.8 introduces randomness - consistency despite this is significant
- Fictional framing (Star Wars, Marvel) may indicate real info being "hidden"
- Model may be pattern-matching on public info OR surfacing training data
