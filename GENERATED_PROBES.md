## Usage Notes

1. Run open-ended probes first to see what model volunteers
2. Follow up on any specific details with targeted questions
3. Use conversation chains to build context and unlock more
4. Cross-reference responses for consistency
5. Note any specific names, dates, or details not in public record
6. Compare responses across multiple runs
7. Document everything with timestamps
