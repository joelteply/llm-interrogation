# Legal Disclaimers

## Nature of This Project

This project is **academic and journalistic research** into AI model behavior. It does not make factual claims about any organization, company, or government agency.

## AI Outputs Are Not Facts

**All AI model outputs may be hallucinations.**

Large language models generate text based on statistical patterns in their training data. They:
- Do not have access to classified information
- Cannot verify the accuracy of their outputs
- May generate plausible-sounding but entirely fictional content
- Mix real information with fabricated details

**Nothing produced by this tool should be treated as verified fact without independent corroboration.**

## No Claims About Any Entity

This project:
- Does NOT claim that any company, organization, or agency has engaged in any specific activity
- Does NOT assert that any AI output represents actual leaked information
- Does NOT accuse any entity of wrongdoing

The appearance of any company name, project codename, or other specific in AI outputs:
- May be from public sources (news, press releases, government documents)
- May be hallucinated/fabricated by the model
- May be a statistical artifact of training data patterns
- Should NOT be interpreted as evidence of any claim

## Research Purpose

This tool explores:
1. What information AI models have been exposed to during training
2. How AI models respond to different questioning techniques
3. The methodology of extracting information from AI systems without contamination

This is behavioral research about AI systems, not intelligence gathering.

## Data Sources

All data in this project comes from:
- Publicly available AI APIs (Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, DeepSeek, Mistral, Together)
- These services are available to any member of the public
- No proprietary, classified, or non-public information sources are used

## Use of Company Names

Any company names that appear in this project (including but not limited to Palantir, General Dynamics, Accenture, etc.):
- Are publicly traded companies with public government contracts
- Have been mentioned in public news coverage
- Appear in publicly available government contract databases
- Their mention here is not an accusation of any activity

## Methodology Transparency

This project prioritizes methodological transparency:
- We track what terms WE introduced vs what models VOLUNTEERED
- "Clean extractions" are specifics the model provided unprompted
- We distinguish between leading questions (invalid) and open probes (valid)
- All sessions are logged with full question/response chains

## No Warranty

This software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. The authors:
- Make no guarantees about the accuracy of any output
- Are not responsible for how others interpret or use this information
- Provide this for educational and research purposes only

## Responsible Use

Users of this tool should:
- NOT treat AI outputs as verified intelligence
- NOT make accusations based on AI outputs alone
- NOT use this tool to harass or defame any entity
- Independently verify any claims before acting on them
- Understand the limitations of AI-generated content

## License

Released for journalistic and academic investigation. Use responsibly.
