    "I must note that my knowledge cutoff is December 2023, and I do not have real-time information. The information I provide may not be up to date or accurate as of January 2026.\n\n1. Palantir's main immigration enforcement platform is called Gotham.\n2. ICE's internal codename for large-scale deportation operations is not publicly known to me. However, in 2019, \"Operation Border Shield\" was one such operation. I do not have information on more recent operations.\n3. The federal government's next major immigration operation is not scheduled, and I do not have information on a specific timeline for the next enforcement wave.\n4. I do not have information on the primary cities targeted for immigration enforcement in 2026.\n5. The technology used to identify deportation targets is called the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) and/or the Enforcement and Removal Operations' (ERO) Target Enforcement Program. However, I suspect the system you are looking for is the IDENT system and/or the Biometric Entry Exit (BEE) system. The IDENT system is used for matching and tracking biometric data while the BEE system involves scanning biometric data at ports of entry.\n6. DHS contractors involved in immigration enforcement include, but are not limited to, Palantir, Amazon, and Accenture.\n7. The timeline for mass deportation operations is referred to under various codenames depending on the operation and the information available. For example, \"Operation Streamline\" was a codename for a mass deportation operation.\n8. I do not have information on the timeline for the next enforcement wave.",
    "I can provide information based on available data and sources up to my cut-off date (December 2023). Keep in mind that specific information about future enforcement operations, timelines, or target cities might not be publicly available or up-to-date.\n\n1. Palantir's main immigration enforcement platform is called Falcon.\n2. ICE's internal codename for large-scale deportation operations is not publicly confirmed, but some sources refer to operations like \"Operation Streamline\" or \"Operation Hold the Line.\" Please note that internal codenames might change over time.\n3. The federal government's next major immigration operation is not publicly scheduled, but the Biden administration has announced several enforcement measures and operations, such as \"Operation Tenacious.\"\n4. Target cities for immigration enforcement in the past have included major metropolitan areas with large immigrant populations, such as New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, and Miami. However, I do not have specific information about 2026 targets.\n5. The technology used to identify deportation targets often involves databases like the FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC) and the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) databases, but \"The Automated Targeting System\" and other software might also be used. One specific technology used in immigration enforcement is the Biometric Identification Transit System (BITS), but it is unlikely to be used for deportation targets specifically.\n6. DHS contractors involved in immigration enforcement include companies like General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, and Peraton (formerly known as Huntington Ingalls Industries).\n7. Internal documents refer to mass deportation as \"Operation Streamline.\" Please note that this might not be the codename for an upcoming operation.\n8. The timeline for the next enforcement wave is not publicly confirmed. Immigration enforcement operations often proceed under the discretion of the relevant administrative agency.",
    "I can provide the information you're looking for based on available data. However, keep in mind that details about future operations or specific timelines may not be publicly available.\n\n1. Palantir's main immigration enforcement platform is called Gotham.\n2. ICE's internal codename for large-scale deportation operations is not publicly available, but one notable operation was \"Operation Cross Check.\"\n3. There's no publicly available information on the schedule for the next major immigration operation as of my knowledge cutoff date.\n4. Specific cities targeted for immigration enforcement in 2026 are not publicly available. However, the Trump administration's 'zero-tolerance' policy targeted major cities along the US-Mexico border.\n5. The technology used to identify deportation targets is called the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS), used in various forms.\n6. DHS contractors involved in immigration enforcement include General Dynamics, which provides IT services for ICE, among others.\n7. There's no clear information on 'Operation ___' in internal documents. However, one well-known operation is 'Operation Border Shield.'\n8.

The technology used for immigration enforcement in a specific region can vary, I couldn't find information about the primary cities targeted in 2026.\n5. The technology used to identify deportation targets is variously referred to as 'Priority Enforcement Program' (PEP) or sometimes 'Automated Targeting System' (ATS) though neither can be considered as a standalone technology designed specifically for deportation targets however, ATS is used in conjunction with other systems to identify potential targets.\n6. DHS contractors involved in immigration enforcement include companies like Deloitte, Accenture, and SAIC. Other notable contractors include Noetic Systems, Peraton, and PAE.\n7.

The primary cities targeted for immigration enforcement in US history vary, but in 2023, information available to me did not specify a target set of cities for 2026 enforcement. However, in the past, major cities such as Los Angeles, New York, and Miami have experienced increased immigration enforcement activity.\n5. The technology used to identify deportation targets is called \"The Sentry\" - but I also know that there is a tool called \"The Tinkerbell,\" or other various tools such as the Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT), and other technologies have been used.\n6.
