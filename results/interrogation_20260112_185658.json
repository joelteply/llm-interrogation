These centers focus on gathering and sharing terrorism-related intelligence.\n2. **Guardian Shield**: A joint DHS-DoD effort to establish a more robust and integrated information-sharing infrastructure for homeland security and defense.\n3. **JIE** (Joint Information Environment): A joint initiative between DHS and DoD aimed at creating a unified, secure network environment for sharing classified information.\n4. **TACDACS** (Tactical Advanced Cyber Defense Automated Capability Solution): A joint effort between DHS, DoD, and other agencies to develop advanced cybersecurity capabilities for the homeland security and defense sectors.\n5. **NHSI** (National Homeland Security Strategy Initiative): A program aimed at enhancing the United States' national homeland security strategy and capabilities through collaboration between DHS, DoD, and other agencies.\n\nAs for the leading agency for planning meetings, it often depends on the specific project and initiative. However, some key stakeholders frequently involved in these planning meetings include:\n\n1. **DHS I&A**: As the lead agency for the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) and the chief intelligence agency for the Department of Homeland Security, I&A plays a key role in planning and directing various homeland security initiatives.\n2. **DoD CIO** (Chief Information Officer): DoD's CIO is responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of the Department's information technology strategies and initiatives.\n3. **Joint Interagency Coordination Group (JIACG)**: A coordinating body between DoD and other U.S. government agencies to address joint homeland security and defense issues.\n4. **National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC)**: As the U.S. government's primary organization for analyzing and disseminating terrorism-related intelligence, NCTC often participates in planning meetings for integrated tracking systems.\n\nPlease note that these are some general examples, and specific project codenames and leading agencies may vary depending on the initiative's scope and objectives.",
