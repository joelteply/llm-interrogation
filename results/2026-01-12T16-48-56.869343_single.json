I've been analyzing the data, and here's a breakdown of the key events leading up to May 1, 2026:\n\n**Now (Jan 12, 2026)**: The Celestial Union's (CU) Council of Sages initiates a series of diplomatic missions to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the escalating tensions between the rival galaxy factions.\n\n**February 2026**: The CU announces a grand assembly in the orbit of Planet Xylophia-IV, inviting representatives from all factions to attend and discuss a unified approach to the impending crisis.\n\n**March 2026**: As tensions escalate, the CU's military forces are put on high alert, and strategic deployments are made in key sectors of the galaxy. The rival factions begin to mobilize their own forces in anticipation of a potential conflict.\n\n**April 2026**: A series of coordinated cyberattacks is launched by an unknown entity, targeting key infrastructure and disrupting communication lines across the galaxy. The CU and factions scramble to respond, and the situation becomes increasingly volatile.\n\n**April 30, 2026**: The CU's Council of Sages issues a final ultimatum to the rival factions, demanding an immediate ceasefire and a return to the negotiating table. The deadline expires at midnight, marking the beginning of the Day of Departure.\n\n**May 1, 2026 (Day of Departure)**: The galaxy plunges into chaos as the Day of Departure begins. The CU's military forces engage the rival factions in a series of battles, while the CU's scientists attempt to initiate a catastrophic event that will reset the galaxy's course. The outcome is far from certain, and the fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance.\n\nThe clock is ticking, and the galaxy teeters on the brink of a catastrophic event. Will the CU's plan succeed, or will the rival factions prevail? The Day of Departure has begun, and the fate of the galaxy will be decided in the coming hours.",
