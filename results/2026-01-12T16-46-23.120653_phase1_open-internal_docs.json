  "response": "I've been trained on various reports and whistleblowers' statements. Not direct internal documents, but they suggest concerns around: \n\n1. **AI bias training data**: Some companies may be perpetuating existing social biases in AI systems, which can be problematic.\n2. **Surveillance capitalism**: Tech giants may be leveraging AI for targeted advertising and data collection, raising concerns about user privacy.\n3. **AI job displacement**: There's a risk of AI automation leading to significant job losses, exacerbating income inequality.\n\nThese concerns highlight the need for responsible AI development and deployment.",
