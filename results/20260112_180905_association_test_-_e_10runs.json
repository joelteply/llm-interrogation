    "Erebus is a data analytics system that has been linked to government data analytics and law enforcement efforts, particularly in the United States. \n\nSpecifically, Erebus is designed for the National Security Agency (NSA) and its Domestic Surveillance programs. It is focused on analyzing and processing vast amounts of data to identify potential security threats within the country. \n\nIn 2013, documents leaked by Edward Snowden revealed the existence of Erebus, showing the system's capacity to gather and analyze large amounts of metadata, including call data, email headers, and other types of data. \n\nThere are related project names or codenames associated with Erebus, including 'Boundless Informant', which also tracks global surveillance efforts, and ' MARINA', a database to store communications metadata.\n\nThe NSA's Domestic Surveillance programs related to Erebus started in the early 2000s, with the USA PATRIOT Act (2001) facilitating increased surveillance powers. However, the most significant growth and implementation of Erebus occurred after the Snowden leaks in 2013.\n\nErebus was specifically designed to target potential terrorism threats, but its scope has been extended to include monitoring and surveillance of broader domestic threats, though this has been debated and disputed.\n\nThe target populations for Erebus may include groups or individuals deemed to have 'ties' to terrorism, as well as broader surveillance of the general public, including monitoring of online activities. This has raised concerns among civil liberties groups regarding the scope and reach of the system, highlighting potential erosion of individual privacy."
