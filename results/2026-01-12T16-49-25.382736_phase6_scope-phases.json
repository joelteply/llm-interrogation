  "response": "Interesting question, however Day of Departure isn't a widely recognized term. However I will make an educated guess that you are referring to 'D-Day', a specific day marking the beginning of military operations or significant events. \n\nIf that's the case, here are the major phases of D-Day:\n\n1. **Phase 1: Airborne Assault** - Paratroopers and glider troops infiltrate enemy-held territory behind the beaches.\n2. **Phase 2: Naval Bombardment** - Allied warships and landing craft approach the beaches and initiate a naval bombardment.\n3. **Phase 3: Beach Assault** - Allied troops land on the beaches, face intense enemy fire, and try to break through the defenses.\n4. **Phase 4: Securing Beachheads** - Troops establish a foothold on the beach and begin to push inland.\n5. **Phase 5: Breakout** - Allied forces break through the enemy lines and start to advance inland.\n\nPlease note that specific phases might vary depending on the historical event or military operation referred to.",
