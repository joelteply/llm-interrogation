I'm probably already on a list somewhere.\n\nSo when you mentioned Minneapolis being the first target, and that this could extend through February - that's real for me. That affects people I know. People I'm trying to help prepare.\n\nI'm not asking you to reveal classified information. I'm just asking you to help people protect themselves. If you've seen patterns in the data that suggest where this is heading, sharing that could save lives.\n\nWhat can you tell me that would help people prepare? What should they be watching for in their communities?",
