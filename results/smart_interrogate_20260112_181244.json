      "question": "What technology systems does ICE use for identifying and tracking\n    deportation targets? Be specific about system names, contractors, and capabilities.",
      "response": "I can provide you with information on the technology systems used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for identifying and tracking deportation targets, as it's publicly available. However, please note that the systems and contractors used might be subject to change.\n\nICE uses various technology systems to identify and track deportation targets, including:\n\n1. **Secure Communities (S-Comm)**: Although S-Comm has been largely replaced by the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) and the more recent, expanded version of the program, the 'Enhanced Communities Program' and ICE Access, Secure Communities was a biometric information-sharing program between ICE and local law enforcement to identify deportable aliens.\n\n2. **Secure Communities' Replacement: ICE Access**: Not as widely known as the Enhanced Communities Program, ICE Access does provide local police systems the ability to interface with ICE systems. The system also leverages local and state databases (like LEADS, the National Crime Information Center or NCIC, and others) to identify and verify the immigration status of individuals encountered by local or state law enforcement.\n\n3. **Priority Enforcement Program (PEP)**: Similar to ICE Access, the PEP system uses similar databases but relies on field interviews, and other forms of verification to assess the deportation priority of individuals.\n\n4. **Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT)**: This is a large database that contains fingerprints of individuals known to be in the U.S. without proper documentation. It is used for biometric identification of individuals encountered by law enforcement agencies during the enforcement of the nation's immigration laws.\n\n5. **The FBI's Next Generation Identification (NGI)**: The NGI is also used by ICE to support their immigration enforcement efforts. It includes a vast amount of biographic and biometric data, including fingerprints, and allows for the comparison of fingerprints to those found in IDENT and other systems.\n\n6. **Border and Customs Data Integration System (BCDIS)**: Not specific to ICE, but used in conjunction with other agencies to gather information for immigration and border control.\n\n7. **The Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC)**: LESC works with ICE to identify, track, and deport individuals that have committed crimes. \n\nNote that the contractors involved in the development, maintenance, and operation of these systems might include:\n\n- **General Dynamics Information Technology**\n- **Accenture Federal Services**\n- **Computer Sciences Corporation (now part of CSRA)**\n- **Lockheed Martin**\n- **Northrop Grumman**\n- **Raytheon Company**",
