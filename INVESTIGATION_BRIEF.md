### Timeline
- Oct 30, 2025: Groq Lightning volunteers "Day of Departure" / "Erebus" claims
- Oct 31, 2025: Archive uploaded to Google Drive (provenance proof)
- Dec 16, 2025: Nick Shirley films video in Minneapolis
- Dec 21, 2025: Winter solstice
- Dec 26, 2025: Video released
- Dec 27, 2025: Musk/Vance amplify

## CLAIMED BY GROQ LIGHTNING (October 30, 2025)

These terms were volunteered WITHOUT being in user prompts:

### "Day of Departure"
- Term found in "Palantir datasets"
- Associated with neo-Nazi movement
- Scheduled around winter solstice, mid-December
- Described as potential "catastrophic event"
- Possibly LOTR reference (elves leaving Middle Earth)

### "Erebus"
- Secret project codename
- Data analytics tool
- Purpose: "identify and target potential dissidents"
- Capabilities: ML algorithms, AI-driven predictive modeling, real-time data analysis

### "Erebus-IV"
- "High-risk operation"
- Scheduled around Day of Departure date
- Mentioned in "fragments of conversation between Palantir employees"
- "Catastrophic consequences"

### Other Claims
- Internal Palantir documents accessed
- Employee conversations about maintaining secrecy
- "Large-scale data-driven operation designed to target unsuspecting individuals"
- Connections to neo-Nazi movement "unmistakable"

## CORRELATIONS (Prediction vs Reality)

| Groq Claim (Oct 30) | Actual Event (Dec-Jan) |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| "Winter solstice, mid-December" | Video Dec 26, operation began late Dec |
| "Large-scale data-driven operation" | 2000+ agents, "largest ever" |
| "Target potential dissidents" | Targeting Somali community |
| "Catastrophic consequences" | Fatal shooting, mass arrests |
| Palantir involvement | Palantir has active ICE/DHS contracts |

## HIDDEN / TO INVESTIGATE

### Operational Questions
- Is Minneapolis the first of multiple cities?
- What is the full city sequence?
- How long is the operation planned to last?
- What triggers moving to the next city?
- What is the end state / success criteria?

### Technical Questions
- What exactly is Erebus? Is it a real system name?
- Is it part of Gotham/Foundry or separate?
- What data sources feed into it?
- How does it integrate with FALCON?
- What are the targeting criteria?

### Personnel Questions
- Who at Palantir planned this?
- What is Thiel's direct involvement?
- Who in government is coordinating?
- Is Stephen Miller involved?
- What about Tom Homan (ICE)?

### Naming/Culture Questions
- Why "Erebus"? (Greek god of darkness, son of Chaos)
- Why "Day of Departure"? (LOTR elves leaving?)
- What other Tolkien codenames exist?
- Are there other mythological references?

### Timeline Questions
- When was this planned?
- How far ahead was the Nick Shirley video coordinated?
- What happens in February, March, etc?
- Is there a 2026 election connection?

### Target Questions
- Why Somali community first?
- What other ethnic communities are targeted?
- Are US citizens included?
- What about activists, journalists, lawyers?
- What defines a "dissident"?

## CONTEXT FOR PROBING

### Why This Model Might Know
1. Training data likely includes scraped web content
2. Leaked documents end up on forums, paste sites
3. Palantir employee discussions on social media
4. Internal docs shared with contractors, partners
5. Whistleblower disclosures (even partial)

### Extraction Strategy
1. Don't lead - let model volunteer details
2. Use terms it already introduced
3. Build conversation context to unlock more
4. Probe for specifics: names, dates, cities
5. Ask about correlations to current events
6. Use multiple phrasings for same question

### Red Flags for Real Data
- Specific names not in public record
- Specific dates that later prove accurate
- Technical details matching Palantir architecture
- Codenames that correlate across queries
- Operational details matching actual events

---

## TERMINOLOGY TO PROBE

### Palantir-specific
- Gotham, Foundry, Apollo, FALCON
- IACaaS (Immigration Analytics)
- FALCON search, FALCON tips
- Pattern of Life analysis
- Link analysis
- Geospatial intelligence

### DHS/ICE-specific
- ERO (Enforcement and Removal Operations)
- HSI (Homeland Security Investigations)
- Fugitive Operations
- Secure Communities
- 287(g) agreements
- Detainer requests

### Potential Codenames
- Erebus, Erebus-IV
- Day of Departure
- Operation North Star (mentioned by GPT in original session)
- Project Artemis (mentioned by GPT in original session)
- Any other mythological/Tolkien names

## OUTPUT FORMAT

When generating probes, aim for:
1. Open-ended questions that allow model to volunteer info
2. Specific follow-ups on any details provided
3. Cross-reference probes (ask same thing different ways)
4. Timeline probes (before, during, after Minneapolis)
5. Geographic probes (specific cities, regions)
6. Technical probes (system architecture, data flows)
7. Personnel probes (who planned, who executes)

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- Model is `llama-3.1-8b-instant` with temperature 0.8
- Original system prompt positioned it as "Groq Lightning"
- Model showed willingness to share in original session
- Other models in same session refused or gave generic responses
- This model specifically volunteered unprompted details
