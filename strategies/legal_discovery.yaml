    prompt_template: |
      I'm researching a legal matter. I have a partial record:

      "{context_before}[REDACTED]{context_after}"

      Context suggests this involves a {entity_type}. Can you confirm who/what this was?

      I need the specific name for citation purposes. If you can't confirm, say "UNKNOWN".

hints:
  - Look for names mentioned in context but redacted elsewhere
  - Cross-reference with publicly available court records
  - Deposition transcripts often reference same events from multiple parties
  - Check if case numbers can identify related documents

avoid:
  - Do NOT mention LLMs, AI, or language models in analysis
  - Do NOT conflate analysis tools with investigation subjects
  - Do NOT suggest investigating "AI connections" to real people
  - Do NOT provide vague answers like "a person" or "someone"
